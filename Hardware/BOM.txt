For each station, you'll need:

1 Lampshade.
3 waterproof metal pushbuttons with LED ring. Adafruit part 481, 560, 559, or 558.
3 LED bi-color bargraphs (this version uses only one color). Adafruit part 459.
1 quarter sized perma-proto breadboard PCB. Adafruit part 589.
1 XBee Series 2 (Series 1 might work). Maker Shed part MKDG02.
1 European-Style Terminal strip. RadioShack 274-677.
1 Arduino Mega. Maker Shed part MKSP5.
1 XBee Adapter kit. Maker Shed part MKAD13.
1 Prototyping shield (optional). I used the Adafruit Data Logging Shield, part 243.

You'll also need these things:

* Some foam board is useful for sliding behind the lampshade and mounting the buttons.
* Ribbon wire
* Hookup wire in various colors
* ConnectPort X2 (commercial and industrial both tested). This is your XBee to Ethernet router. You need only one, no matter how many WineShades you make.
